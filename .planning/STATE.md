# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-02-10)

**Core value:** A working OXC-based Qwik optimizer crate that passes all 162 spec tests
**Current focus:** Phase 9 -- Capture Analysis + Props Destructuring

## Current Position

Phase: 9 of 13 (Capture Analysis + Props Destructuring)
Plan: 1 of 2 in current phase -- COMPLETE
Status: Props destructuring implemented. Ready for Plan 09-02 (capture analysis).
Last activity: 2026-02-11 -- Completed 09-01: Props destructuring transformation

Progress: [#########░░░░░░░░░░░] 42% (22/31 total plans across all milestones; v3.0 5/14)

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Full decision log in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- 9-tier CONV implementation order validated in cross-reference (dependency graph drives phase structure)
- Two-option PURE annotation strategy: Option A (OXC built-in) preferred, Option B (manual comment) fallback
- Props destructuring must run before capture analysis (CONV-11 before CONV-05)
- CONV-10 must run before CONV-09 (const replacement before stripping)
- oxc 0.113: parser/traverse always included (not features); codegen/semantic/serialize are features
- oxc_traverse 0.113 TraverseCtx requires State generic parameter
- Case-insensitive config key matching for spec parser (Transpile TS vs Transpile Ts)
- EmitMode::Test mapped to EmitMode::Lib (specs mark Test as default)
- base64 made non-optional in Cargo.toml (hash needs it unconditionally)
- OXC 0.113 BindingPattern is a flat enum (no kind field); JSXExpression uses inherit_variants! (Expression variants directly on enum)
- Collector uses two-pass recursive walk (not Traverse trait) for read-only analysis
- Use exit_expression (not exit_call_expression) for QRL replacement -- gives mutable &mut Expression
- Arena string allocation via ctx.ast.atom() for runtime-constructed strings in AstBuilder
- std::mem::swap with ctx.ast.vec() for OXC Vec mutation (no Default impl)
- expression_call_with_pure for PURE annotations on qrl/inlinedQrl calls
- Pending dollar calls tracked by span.start u32 in HashSet for O(1) lookup
- Post-analysis mutation pattern for props destructuring: analyze in enter_call_expression, mutate in exit_expression
- Recursive walk for identifier replacement with scope-aware shadowing for nested arrows
- param_names as Option<Vec<String>> on SegmentAnalysis with skip_serializing_if
